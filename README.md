# simple-password-gen

very simple random password generator

currently only has the ability to include one of each ASCII character,  with the exception of \n \t \r \x0b \x0c and  ' '

now, there is a feature that asks users if they want to add symbols or numbers to their passwords.

added a feature to determine password strength. 

if anything other than "y" or "n" is typed in when asked to include numbers or symbols, a message will come up asking the user to type either "y" or "n".

planning to add a GUI (I have no idea how to create one so it will take a while).
