# simple-password-gen

very simple random password generator

has the ability to include one of each ASCII character,  with the exception of \n \t \r \x0b \x0c and  ' '

There is a feature that asks users if they want to add symbols or numbers to their passwords.

A UI was created for the code, but I'm still trying to fix a few small things. 
Notably, the issue where if you select "y" or "n" for either the "add symbols?" or "add numbers?" prompts, after pressing OK and a password is genereted and then you change the options for either of the two prompt, it doesn't update, so it'll stay stuck at the first option you chose. It's going to take a bit of time for me to fix it.
